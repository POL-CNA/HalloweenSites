<p class="fade-in" style="animation-delay: 2s;">The bearer of the stone mask jerks his head in your direction.</p>

<p class="fade-in" style="animation-delay: 7s;">He tilts his head in various manners, presumably trying to get an angle on you through the questionable mask.</p>

<p class="weird-mask-text" style="animation-delay: 10s; ">Suddenly, he feigns a rush towards you like a wild animal- which works- because you turn tail and haul out of there.</p>

<p class="fade-in" style="animation-delay: 14s;color:rgb(198, 198, 198); font-style: italic;">I was just trying to be nice.. what a weirdo.</p>
