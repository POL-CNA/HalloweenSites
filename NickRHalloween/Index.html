<p>In the quiet village of Telč, nestled among the rolling hills of southern Czechia, the air turned crisp as October waned. The cobblestone streets glistened with morning dew, and the scent of woodsmoke drifted from chimneys. It was All Souls’ Day—Dušičky—a time when the living remembered the dead.</p>

<p>Anna, a retired schoolteacher, wrapped her wool shawl tighter around her shoulders as she stepped out of her cottage. In her basket were candles, chrysanthemums, and a small lantern carved from tin. She walked slowly toward the cemetery on the hill, where generations of her family rested beneath moss-covered stones.</p>

<p>The cemetery was already alive with quiet activity. Families moved among the graves, brushing away leaves, lighting candles, and placing flowers. The flickering lights created a sea of gentle flames, each one a memory, a prayer, a whisper to the past.
    Anna knelt by her husband’s grave, tracing the letters of his name with her fingers. “Ahoj, Petře,” she murmured. “I brought your favorite yellow chrysanthemums.” She lit the lantern and placed it beside the stone, watching the flame dance in the windless air.</p>

<p>Nearby, a young boy named Jakub wandered curiously among the graves, his grandmother guiding him gently. “Why do we light candles?” he asked.
    “To show them we remember,” she replied. “Even if they’re gone, they’re still part of us.”
    As dusk fell, the cemetery glowed like a constellation on earth. Bells from the church tower rang softly, and the villagers stood in silence. Anna looked around and saw faces she’d known all her life—some old, some new—all gathered in reverence.
    That night, as Anna returned home, she felt a warmth in her heart. Dušičky was not just about mourning—it was about connection. The living and the dead, bound by memory, by love, by light.</p>

<h4>Origins of Dušičky</h4>

<p>On November 2nd of every year the holiday of Dušičky which means "Little Souls". This tradition came from the Celts whilst they were living in central Europe who beleived that the border between the worlds of the living and dead was very thin during this time, and the tradition was called "Samhain". After the celts, the Slavs arrived, who modified Sahain and adopted it into their culture. In 998 the chuch attempted to christanize the holiday and emphasized remembering the dead rather than leadings souls to the underground.</p>


<h5></h5>Modern Celebration</h5>

</p>In modern times Dušičky is used as a day of rememberance for lost loved ones regardless of their religious beliefs. Families visit cemeteries to clean and decorate graves with flowers, wreaths, and thousands of candles which create a "sea of lights." During Dušičky the day is quiet and contemplative to honor those loved ones who passed.
