        <p><il>1. </il>October 31, 1999 12:46am — In a quiet Midwestern town, residents tuning in to KRVN 103.6 FM expected to hear the usual late-night jazz broadcast. Instead, they were met with a trembling voice reading local obituaries, each name eerily familiar to listeners still very much alive. Police reports indicate that within minutes of the broadcast, phone lines jammed with callers insisting the voices were “layered”—multiple tones overlapping, like whispers played backward. The transmission lasted exactly 7 minutes and 13 seconds before cutting to static. By dawn, the radio tower had gone dark. No staff were found inside the station, and the logbooks ended mid-entry. Investigators only recovered a melted reel labeled “Do Not Air – Route 9.” Witnesses claim to see the creature in this appearance right before they ate someone. Locals refer to the event as <em>The Last Broadcast</em>. Every Halloween since, car radios near Route 9 flicker alive for thirteen seconds, replaying the faint hum of that night’s transmission—followed by distant breathing. “We thought it was a prank,” one former deputy said. “But that sound... it wasn’t from this world.”</p>

        <il></il>2.</il><p>October 31, 1999 1:39 am — On the same night instead of just a radio broadcast, the creature decided to take form into onto his victims in a new distorted face. they appeared coming out of the ground in a orphanage in one of the bedroom filled with sleeping kids ready to celebrate halloween with their friends. Little did they know they would never get to celebrate Halloween ever again. When trying to find evidence the footage on security camera in the room was found courrupted, the only thing that remained was this audio recording from that same secuirty camera. This is the last moments before he striked, his iconic sneaky theme song playing before he took more lives from the innocent. This is what survivors saw as he took the lives of their friends. </p>
