            Halloween is celebrated in Mexico on October 31st, but it’s often closely tied with
            Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), which takes place on November 1st and 2nd.
            While Halloween focuses on costumes and fun, Día de los Muertos is about honoring
            and remembering loved ones who have passed away.

                <h2>Story: Preparing for Día de los Muertos</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone got ready for Día de los Muertos in the little town of San Felipe del Monte, where the marigolds glowed like embers and the mountains obscured the moon. The petals of cempasúchils shimmered in the streets, beckoning the deceased back to their homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, not every spirit was accepted. Marisol lived on the outskirts of town with her abuela, who taught her the sacred rituals, such as placing each picture on the altar, lighting candles, and whispering the names of the deceased to help them find their way back. Abuela would always say, "Every soul must have its light." "The spirit loses its path when a candle goes out."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Abuela passed away in late October of that year. Marisol constructed her first altar by herself. She struck a match, and every candle suddenly blazed with fire as the spark burst, bright as dawn. She briefly caught a glimpse of Abuela's gentle eyes behind the flames as the marigold petals rose in a golden swirl. Abuela's voice murmured, "Remember. Even lost souls look for light." Then there was silence in the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the morning, Marisol discovered a fresh picture of a young man she had never seen before standing next to a field of marigolds on the altar. A name had been written in faded ink beneath it: "Miguel, 1887." She never removed it and lit an additional candle each year in remembrance of the forgotten people still trying to find their way home.
