    <h1>The Story of Salimata – The Woman Who Escaped Death</h1>
<ol>
    <p>Salimata (not her real name) was a woman from a small village near Tamale, in northern Ghana. In her early 60s, she lived quietly as a widow, known for her strong personality and herbal knowledge — traits that, in her community, were a double-edged sword.
    One evening, a child in her family fell suddenly ill and died overnight. The death was unexplained, and grief quickly turned into whispers. “She looked at the child the wrong way,” someone said. “She has powers.”
    Soon, the murmurs grew louder: Salimata was a witch.</p>

    <p>In the village, once an accusation begins, it’s almost impossible to stop. People gathered outside her home, shouting, throwing stones. Some said they had dreamt of her “spirit” chasing them at night. Others claimed she had “eaten” their luck.
    Her nephew — one of the few who pitied her — told her to flee before they came back with machetes. That night, she walked miles through the bush, barefoot, guided only by the moon, until she reached Gambaga, the oldest of the witch camps.
    At Gambaga, she was met by the chief of the camp, known locally as the Gambarrana. He performed a ritual test — sacrificing a chicken. If it died face down, she was guilty. If it died face up, innocent.</p>

    <p>From that moment, Salimata was officially branded a witch. She was given a mud hut and told she could live there safely — but she could never go home.</p>

    <p>In the camp, she met hundreds of other women with similar stories — mothers, grandmothers, even a few young women — all exiled for invisible crimes. They farmed tiny plots of land, shared food, and lived on aid from churches and NGOs.
    Visitors often came, journalists and charity workers, photographing them like ghosts of a forgotten world.</p>

    <p>When the Ghanaian government began trying to close the witch camps, Gambaga became a symbol of both hope and fear. Salimata and others were offered a chance to go home — but she refused. She said, “If I go back, they will kill me.”
    She died in the camp a few years later, buried under a small mound of red earth. No one from her family came. But the other women gathered, sang, and poured water over her grave — a ritual to calm her spirit and keep it from wandering back to haunt the living.</p>

    <p>Salimata’s story — like hundreds of others — captures the strange duality of Ghana’s witch camps: They are haunted by superstition, yet also havens from violence. They are places of fear, but also of community.
    In the end, the spookiest thing about the witch camps isn’t magic at all — it’s how real belief can become, and how powerful fear can be in shaping people’s fate.</p>
