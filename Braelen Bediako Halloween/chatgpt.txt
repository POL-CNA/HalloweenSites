One spooky tradition from Ghana that often fascinates people is the **Homowo Festival’s connection with ancestral spirits**—particularly in Ga communities (around Accra). While Homowo itself is primarily a harvest and thanksgiving festival, parts of it involve deep respect and interaction with the spirit world, which can have eerie undertones.

Here’s the spooky side of it 👻:

### 👻 The Ancestral Night (Spirit Visits)

Before the main celebration, there’s a period when people believe **the spirits of ancestors return** to visit the living. During this time, the community keeps quiet at night, drums and loud noises are banned, and people avoid certain activities so as not to disturb the spirits. It’s said that if you break the silence or disobey these taboos, the spirits might become angry — bringing misfortune or illness.

### ⚰️ Libations and Spirit Offerings

Elders pour **libations (drinks offered to spirits)** and recite incantations to invite ancestors to join in the feast. Offerings of food—especially *kpokpoi*, a traditional maize dish—are left at crossroads and doorsteps for wandering spirits. These crossroads are believed to be portals where the living and dead meet, a concept that gives the night an eerie feeling.

### 💀 Protective Rituals

During and after the festival, some families perform **cleansing rituals** to send the spirits back peacefully. If not done properly, people fear restless ghosts might linger around the home, causing strange noises, sickness, or bad luck.

If you’re looking for something even darker, there are also traditional **“witch camps”** in northern Ghana—places where people accused of witchcraft live in exile. Their stories and the rituals surrounding them are chilling reminders of how the supernatural still deeply influences Ghanaian beliefs.

Would you like me to tell you more about the witch camps or another spooky Ghanaian festival (like the *Aboakyer* hunt or the *Damba* night rituals)?
