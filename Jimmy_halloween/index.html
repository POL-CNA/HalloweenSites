    <p>They say if you‚Äôre out late in the woods around 6:07 PM and you hear ticking stop all at once‚Ä¶ run.Because that‚Äôs
            when he comes.They call him the 6 7 Man a tall figure with green skin, an afro that glows faintly orange in the
            moonlight, and gold chains and rings that jingle softly, like wind chimes made of bones. He isn‚Äôt after people
            not right away at least. He‚Äôs after time itself.</p>
    <p>Everywhere he goes, clocks die.School clocks, wristwatches, even the blinking digits on microwaves. He doesn‚Äôt
            smash them for fun he erases them, until every clock in the room freezes on 6:07. That‚Äôs his mark. His moment.No
            one knows why.</p>

                of a evil being that has
                green skin and goild jewlery, the picture seems to have been taken in
                    the dark and while running since it looks very blury and distorted">
            </div>
            
    <p>Some folks say he died at 6:07 one night electrocuted while stealing a diamond watch. Others whisper he made a
            deal with something dark, trading his soul to live forever‚Ä¶ so long as no clock could ever tick past the moment
            he made the deal.But time doesn‚Äôt like to be stolen.So now he‚Äôs cursed to destroy it.</p>
            <img class="image_med" id="dark" src="evil_67.png" >
    <p>One night, the police thought they‚Äôd caught him.They tracked the green man to an abandoned subway station, filled
            with shattered clocks. The captain said, ‚ÄúFreeze, freak!‚Äù and that‚Äôs when the laughing started. Low, scratchy,
            like broken vinyl on a record player.He snapped his fingers, and from the shadows came flying jack-o‚Äô-lanterns
            dozens of them, carved with wicked grins, orange light pouring from their eyes. They screamed as they flew,
            spinning and swooping through the air. The pumpkins crashed into police cars, wrapped their vines around the
            wheels, and lifted the vehicles off the ground like toys.The officers were never seen again.Some people say
            those same patrol cars can be found deep in the woods, engines still idling, clocks on their dashboards forever
            stuck at 6:07.So if you‚Äôre out camping and your phone glitches to 6:07 even for a second and all goes quiet‚Ä¶
            don‚Äôt look at your watch. Don‚Äôt check the time.Because if you do, you might just see his reflection staring back
            at you a grin full of gold, eyes glowing like clock faces, and the faint whisper of chains</p>
    <p>‚ÄúSix‚Ä¶ or‚Ä¶ seven‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
    <p>And when you blink all the clocks around you will stop.</p>
    
        
        
        <h2>how to survive the 6 7 man </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>all you have to do is survive 41 minits after the clocks stop working </li>
        <li>first you want to make sure your stocked up on mangos</li>
        <li>you then want to eat the mangos because the 6 7 man's jack-o‚Äô-lanterns hate the taste of the mangos</li>
        <li>now to deal with the vines you will want to pour still water on yourself to get slippery </li>
        <li>the only thing i can say now is to RUN!!!!</li>
    </ol>
