<p>The olive trees around Deir Safa leaned like old women whispering secrets. Every evening, when the last light burned out of the sky, the spring below the hill began to cry.</p>
<p>It wasn’t loud — not a scream, not even a sob. Just a thin, trembling sound, like someone trying not to be heard.The villagers said it was the spirit of Layla, who had vanished generations ago while fetching water at dusk.</p>
<p>No one had seen her ghost — not clearly — but sometimes, people swore they saw the surface of the spring ripple with a shadow, long black hair fanning over the water.</p>
<p> One night, a boy named Sami went to the spring. His mother was ill, and the well near their house had gone dry. He carried a lantern and an empty clay jug, and though his grandmother warned him — “The water cries for the living, habibi; don’t listen or it will take you too” — he went anyway.</p> 
<p>When he reached the spring, the air was cold. The olive leaves had stopped moving. He knelt to fill the jug, and then he heard it — a soft, aching sob, the sound of someone lost too long.</p>
<p>He froze. “Layla?” he whispered, though he didn’t know why. A woman’s voice answered — not from the air, but from the water itself: “Don’t pity me, child. Pity those who forget the land that remembers them.” The lantern went out. The jug filled on its own, bubbling softly. Sami stumbled home without looking back.</p>
<p>The next morning, the jug still sat by the door, full to the brim — but the water shimmered like tears.
    And though his mother recovered, Sami never again went near the spring.
    He said sometimes, when the wind came from the valley, he could still hear her whisper:
    
    “The land remembers… even what we wish it would forget.”</p>
<p>Boo!</p>
