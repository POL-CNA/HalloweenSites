    <p> On a cold, misty Halloween night in the Scottish Highlands, young Ewan MacLeod ignored his grandmother’s warning and took the old path across the moor. The wind howled through the heather, carrying whispers that seemed almost like voices, and the moon glowed like a pale lantern over the hills. As he walked, Ewan heard a faint, eerie tune drifting through the fog — the mournful sound of bagpipes. Curiosity pricked him, and despite the unease crawling up his spine, he followed the music across the moor until he came upon the ruins of a centuries-old stone church, half-hidden by mist and ivy. Shadows flickered inside, moving as though dancing, but when he peered closer, Ewan saw pale, hollow-eyed figures spinning in a silent reel, their faces twisted in eternal sorrow. </p>
    



    <p> Frozen with fear, Ewan tried to step back, but the ghostly piper turned toward him, its empty black eyes staring through him like the cold void of night. The haunting music rose and swirled around him, and Ewan felt an invisible pull drawing him closer to the ruins. Tripping over a cracked gravestone, he scrambled to his feet, desperate to escape, but the shadows seemed to stretch and reach for him, their silent dance growing ever more frantic. Just as his courage faltered completely, the music stopped. The wind died, and the moor fell silent. In the darkness, the ruined church seemed empty once more, as though the spirits had never been there. </p>




    <p> The next morning, villagers found Ewan’s footprints leading toward the old church — but none coming back. They whispered that the veil between the living and the dead had thinned on Samhain night, and those who dared wander too far from the safety of hearth and home risked being drawn into the ghostly dance forever. Some say that on stormy Halloween nights, the haunting tune of the ghost piper can still be heard drifting over the misty moors, warning travelers not to follow curiosity where spirits roam. And if you listen closely, you might just hear the hollow echo of Ewan’s footsteps, forever trapped between the living world and the shadowy realm of the dead. </p>
