        <p>October 31, 1999 — In a quiet Midwestern town, residents tuning in to KRVN 103.6 FM expected to hear the usual late-night jazz broadcast. Instead, they were met with a trembling voice reading local obituaries, each name eerily familiar to listeners still very much alive.</p>

        <p>Police reports indicate that within minutes of the broadcast, phone lines jammed with callers insisting the voices were “layered”—multiple tones overlapping, like whispers played backward. The transmission lasted exactly 7 minutes and 13 seconds before cutting to static.</p>

        <p>By dawn, the radio tower had gone dark. No staff were found inside the station, and the logbooks ended mid-entry. Investigators only recovered a melted reel labeled “Do Not Air – Route 9.” Witnesses claim to see the creature in this appearance right before they ate someone.</p>

        <p>Locals refer to the event as <em>The Last Broadcast</em>. Every Halloween since, car radios near Route 9 flicker alive for thirteen seconds, replaying the faint hum of that night’s transmission—followed by distant breathing.</p>

        <p>“We thought it was a prank,” one former deputy said. “But that sound... it wasn’t from this world.”</p>
