    <h1>🎃 Happy Halloween 🎃</h1>
    <p>Mara never liked the mirror in her grandmother’s house. It was tall and old, with an ornate wooden frame carved with faces — eyes too deep, smiles too wide. Her grandmother always kept it covered with a sheet.</p>
    <p>“Don’t look in it after dark,” she used to say. “It remembers what it sees.”</p>
    <p>When her grandmother passed away, Mara inherited the house. The first night she spent there, the wind howled through the halls, and the mirror stood uncovered in the corner of her room. She told herself it was just superstition.</p>
    <p>Around midnight, she woke to the sound of whispering — faint, almost like her name. Maraaa…  She sat up. The room was empty.</p>
    <p>But in the mirror, her reflection was still lying down. <a href="scary.html">the mirror...</a></p>
    <p>Frozen, she watched as her mirrored self slowly sat up — its movements just a beat too slow. The reflection smiled at her, though she hadn’t moved a muscle. Then it raised a hand and pressed it to the glass.</p>
    <p>When Mara finally found the courage to move, she stumbled forward — but her reflection didn’t mimic her this time. It only tilted its head and mouthed words she couldn’t hear. Then it turned away, walking deeper into the dark space <i>behind</i> the reflection.</p>
    <p>The mirror’s surface rippled once… and went still.</p>
    <p>The next morning, when her neighbors came to check on her, the house was quiet. They found the mirror covered again — and behind the glass, faintly visible when the sheet shifted, was Mara’s face, frozen mid-scream.</p>
